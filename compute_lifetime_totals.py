"""
Maintain a running lifetime total of water actually harvested per station —
the number the Impact page shows — without streaming a station's entire
reading history on every page load. The active stations already have
125,000-500,000+ readings each; recomputing that live per request would take
minutes, not the sub-second response a landing page needs.

Uses the same filtered weight-delta-sum logic as the backend's hourly
aggregation (awh_az/backend/main.py, `_compute_hourly_aggregation_sync`):
deltas below WEIGHT_NOISE_FLOOR_G are dropped before summing, because some
stations' balance readings jitter +/-5-25g between readings with no real
accumulating trend (see the "Ignore weight-delta jitter" commit — naively
summing every positive wobble overcounted one station's 2-day production by
~50x). Keep this constant in sync with that function if it ever changes.

Persists progress into `stations/{name}/aggregates/lifetime_totals` in
Firestore, checkpointed by timestamp cursor (not offset — Firestore offset
pagination re-skips-and-discards every prior document, which gets
prohibitively slow past the first few pages). Every run only reads readings
that arrived since the last run, so the first run is the only expensive one;
after that it's incremental and cheap. Safe to re-run or interrupt at any
point — progress is checkpointed after every batch.
