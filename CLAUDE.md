## 1. Project Identity

**Full name:** AzAWH — Arizona Atmospheric Water Harvesting Monitoring System  
**Lab:** SSEBE (School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment), Arizona State University  
**Owner/Author:** Mounusha Ram Metti — MS Data Science, ASU (GPA 4.0, Expected Dec 2026)  
**Contact:** mmetti@asu.edu | mounushametti.vercel.app | github.com/Mounusha25  
**Status as of 2026-09-18:** Production operational — 1.58M+ real sensor records across
9 deployed monitoring stations (1 currently reporting live data; the rest have gone inactive
at various points but their full historical record remains served) and 14 environmental
parameters. Research extension actively in development.

---

## 2. What This Project Is

This is a **full-stack cyber-physical environmental monitoring platform** for
Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH) stations deployed at ASU. AWH stations extract
liquid water directly from humid air using fan-driven airflow over a desiccant or
cooling surface.

This system does three things:
1. **Collects** — Raspberry Pi scripts at each physical station read hardware sensors
   (anemometers, flow meters, balances, power meters, pump controllers) and write
   data to Firebase Firestore in real time
2. **Stores and serves** — A Firebase → PostgreSQL ingestion worker moves data into
   a relational/time-series database; a FastAPI backend exposes that data as a
   typed, cached REST API
3. **Visualizes** — A Next.js dashboard (separate repo: `az_awh_dashboard`) consumes
   the API and renders per-station analytics, time-series charts, harvesting efficiency
   metrics, and data exports

This is **not** a data science prototype. It is a production monitoring system that
has been running live since October 2025 with real hardware, real data, and real
operational use by the SSEBE lab.

## 3. Research Objective and Vision

### The Problem
Environmental sensor networks generate continuous multi-parameter data streams.
A single anomaly in one sensor parameter could be sensor noise OR a real physical
event. Current systems evaluate parameters independently via static rule-based
thresholds — producing high false-alert rates and providing no attribution of
which sensor caused the anomaly versus which merely responded to it.

### The Vision
Transform this operational monitoring platform into an **Autonomous Environmental
Sensor Intelligence system** — a multi-agent MLOps framework that:
- Detects multi-parameter co-anomalies across all 14 sensor parameters simultaneously
- Attributes anomalies to their causal sensor parameter with confidence calibration
- Adapts automatically to sensor calibration drift through automated retraining pipelines
- Generates natural-language incident summaries for non-specialist field engineers
  and regulatory stakeholders using RAG-grounded LLMs

### The Three Research Questions
- **RQ1 — Attribution accuracy:** Can a LangGraph-orchestrated multi-agent system
  (LSTM + Isolation Forest) achieve F1 > 0.80 on anomaly attribution where
  rule-based baselines achieve F1 < 0.65?
- **RQ2 — Drift-adaptive retraining:** Can an Evidently AI-monitored,
  Airflow-orchestrated retraining pipeline recover to within 5% of pre-drift F1
  within 48 hours of drift detection?
- **RQ3 — Stakeholder response quality:** Do LLM-generated incident summaries
  enable correct intervention decisions at least 25% faster than numeric alert tables?

### Publication Target
**Environmental Modelling & Software** (Elsevier, IF 4.9)  
Working title: *Confidence-Calibrated Anomaly Attribution in Multi-Parameter
Environmental Sensor Networks: A Multi-Agent MLOps Framework with Drift-Adaptive Retraining*  
Preprint: arXiv (cs.LG + eess.SP) on system completion

### ⚠️ Production / deployment repos — read before pushing anything

**As of 2026-09-22, `azawhasu-team/AzAWH-Project` is the main/canonical repo.**
Every change — backend, dashboard, docs, anything — must be pushed there.
Render's backend deploy is a separate, narrower exception layered on top of
that (see below); it does not change the "push everything to the main repo"
rule.

- **Dashboard (Next.js, Vercel → `azawhdashboard.vercel.app`)** deploys **only**
  from `https://github.com/azawhasu-team/AzAWH-Project` (branch `main`). Do not
  push dashboard changes to `Mounusha25/az_awh_dashboard` expecting them to go
  live — verified 2026-09-09 that they don't. Nothing reads from any
  `Mounusha25/*` repo for the live dashboard.
- **Backend (FastAPI, Render → `az-awh-monitoring-system.onrender.com`)**
  still deploys from `https://github.com/Mounusha25/az_awh_monitoring_system`
  (branch `main`) as of 2026-09-22 — confirmed 2026-09-12 by pushing an
  `awh_az/backend/main.py` change there and watching Render redeploy. Render
  has **not** been repointed at `azawhasu-team/AzAWH-Project`. This is the one
  place `Mounusha25/az_awh_monitoring_system` still matters operationally; for
  everything else it is legacy and nothing reads from it.

**So the push rule is: every commit goes to `azawhasu-team/AzAWH-Project`
(the main repo, required for all changes), and additionally to
`Mounusha25/az_awh_monitoring_system` for backend/monitoring-system changes
(required only so Render actually redeploys — that repo is otherwise not
read by anything live).** A dashboard-only change still only needs the
`azawhasu-team/AzAWH-Project` push. If unsure whether a push actually took
effect, verify directly — curl the live backend's `/openapi.json` for the new
path, or check the live dashboard — rather than assuming.

This local checkout (`Mounusha25/az_awh_monitoring_system`, with
`az_awh_dashboard` as a git submodule) remains the working copy for editing.
`azawhasu-team/AzAWH-Project` is a separate **monorepo** with the same
top-level layout as this repo (confirmed: `awh_az/backend/` and
`awh_az/water-station-dashboard/` both exist there), but its git history is
unrelated/diverged from both `Mounusha25` repos (confirmed via
`git merge-base`), so a normal `git push` into it isn't possible from this
local checkout. To ship **any** change (backend or dashboard) there:

1. Make/verify the change in this local checkout as normal, and push it to
   `Mounusha25/az_awh_monitoring_system` first if it's a backend change
   (needed for Render).
2. Clone `azawhasu-team/AzAWH-Project` fresh into a scratch directory.
3. Diff the locally-changed files against that clone's copy at the matching
   path (backend: `awh_az/backend/...`; dashboard:
   `awh_az/water-station-dashboard/...`) to find exactly what changed —
   exclude `.env*`, `next-env.d.ts`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `node_modules`, `.next`.
4. Copy just those files into the clone, `git add`/commit/push from there.

Do this for **every** change now, not just dashboard ones — the old
"backend-only changes just need `git push origin main` from this checkout"
shortcut is no longer sufficient on its own; it still gets the Render deploy,
but the change also needs to land in `azawhasu-team/AzAWH-Project` via the
clone-diff-copy procedure above to be reflected in the main repo.

## 5. Data Model — The 14 Sensor Parameters

Every measurement record carries these fields. This is the vocabulary of the project.

| Field | Type | Source | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 | Station runtime | When the reading was taken |
| `station_id` | int (FK) | Database | Links to `stations` table |
| `temperature` | float °C | Intake anemometer (ttyUSB2) | Intake air temperature |
| `humidity` | float % | Intake anemometer (ttyUSB2) | Intake air relative humidity |
| `velocity` | float m/s | Intake anemometer (ttyUSB2) | Intake airflow velocity |
| `unit` | string | Intake anemometer | Velocity unit string |
| `outtake_temperature` | float °C | Outtake anemometer (ttyUSB3) | Outtake air temperature |
| `outtake_humidity` | float % | Outtake anemometer (ttyUSB3) | Outtake air relative humidity |
| `outtake_velocity` | float m/s | Outtake anemometer (ttyUSB3) | Outtake airflow velocity |
| `outtake_unit` | string | Outtake anemometer | Velocity unit string |
| `weight` | float g | Balance (ttyUSB0) | Water collected (delta = harvest rate) |
| `pump_status` | string/int | Pump controller | Pump operational state |
| `voltage` | float V | Power meter | Supply voltage |
| `power` | float W | Power meter | Instantaneous power draw |
| `energy` | float kWh | Power meter | Cumulative energy consumed |
| `flow_lmin` | float L/min | Flow meter (GPIO 27) | Water flow rate |
| `flow_hz` | float Hz | Flow meter (GPIO 27) | Raw pulse frequency |
| `flow_total` | float L | Flow meter (GPIO 27) | Cumulative volume |

**Important:** All fields are `Optional` / `None`-able in `models.py` because
different stations may not have all sensors installed. The system is designed
for heterogeneous hardware configurations.

---

## 6. Hardware Layer — Raspberry Pi Station

Each AWH station runs a Raspberry Pi with `RPi_USB_Package/`. USB port assignments:

| Device | Port | Protocol |
|--------|------|----------|
| Balance scale | `/dev/ttyUSB0` | Serial 9600 baud, ASCII (`ST,GS,-0.123`) |
| Power meter | `/dev/ttyUSB1` | Serial |
| Intake anemometer | `/dev/ttyUSB2` | Serial 9600 baud, binary (`\xeb\xa0` header, 16 bytes) |
| Outtake anemometer | `/dev/ttyUSB3` | Serial 9600 baud, binary (`\xeb\xa0` header, 16 bytes) |
| Flow meter | GPIO pin 27 | Pulse output, open-collector (pull_up=True), K=2800 pulses/L |

**Anemometer packet format:**
`\xeb\xa0` + byte3 (mode) + byte4 (unit) + 2B humidity + 2B temperature + 6B velocity
(3×16-bit values averaged with scale factor 1.53 / (0x98 * 3 / 3))

**Known hardware notes:**
- Run `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` once for permanent serial port access
- Use udev rules for stable port names: `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-awh-sensors.rules`
- Flow sensor requires active water flow to produce non-zero readings
- Anemometers must be physically powered ON and in continuous output mode
- If `ttyUSB` ports shift after reboot, run `dmesg | grep ttyUSB` to remap

## 9. Research Extension Tech Stack (Summer 2026 — In Development)

Phases 1–3 are built and have been run at least once; Phases 4–5 are NOT yet in
the codebase and remain the next phases per the research proposal.

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2) — Streaming Foundation ✅ Built
Lives in `research_extension/phase1_streaming/`:
- `producer.py` — Kafka producer; replays PostgreSQL sensor rows in
  chronological order (`--mode replay|live`, `--speed`, `--since`) to topic
  `awh-sensor-readings`
- `consumer.py` — Spark Structured Streaming consumer; computes windowed
  features (mean/std/min/max, 30-min sliding window, 5-min step) and writes
  to the `windowed_features` table
- `schema_windowed_features.sql` — target table schema
- `mlflow_setup.py` — creates the `AWH-AnomalyDetection` MLflow experiment
- `docker-compose.yml` — local Kafka broker
- `requirements_phase1.txt` — kafka-python, pyspark, mlflow, psycopg2, pandas
  (resolved for Python 3.14 / macOS arm64; needs Java 11 for pyspark)
- **Apache Kafka** — simulated real-time sensor event streaming
- **Apache Spark Structured Streaming** — windowed feature aggregation
  (30-min sliding window, 5-min step) → writes to `windowed_features` table
- **MLflow** — experiment tracking setup

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3–4) — Anomaly Detection Models ✅ Built
Lives in `research_extension/phase2_models/`. 14 rounds of iteration are logged
in `PENDING_TASKS.md` Part C — highlights: a real data-pipeline bug (dead/frozen
sensors silently contaminating the "clean" baseline, fixed round 10–11), an
8x real-station expansion after finding the local Postgres mirror was stale
(round 12), and scoping the benchmark down to the 4 features the lab actually
uses (round 13), which roughly doubled every model's score.
- **PyTorch** — LSTM temporal anomaly/attribution model (`lstm_attribution_model.py`) — current best, attribution F1 = 0.415
- **scikit-learn** — Isolation Forest ensemble (`isolation_forest_model.py`), supervised RandomForest classifier, two-stage model, rule baseline
- **MLflow** — experiment tracking (`AWH-AnomalyDetection`, same tracking DB as Phase 1)
- Target: F1 > 0.80 on held-out test set (rule-based baseline: F1 < 0.65) — **not yet reached**; 0.415 is the current honest ceiling after 14 rounds across 5 model families. See [[research_phase2_attribution_status]] memory / PENDING_TASKS.md for the full history before attempting further model changes.

### Phase 3 (Weeks 4–5) — Multi-Agent Orchestration ✅ Built
Lives in `research_extension/phase3_agents/`. Orchestrates the Phase 2 models
(Isolation Forest ensemble) rather than replacing them — `run_pipeline.py` is
the demo entry point.
- **LangGraph** — `StateGraph` with parallel fan-out/fan-in + conditional
  early-exit (most windows are normal — the graph skips the LLM call
  entirely rather than reaching the incident/escalation nodes)
- **Agents:**
  - `SensorDriftAgent` — wraps the saved Isolation Forest ensemble to flag anomalous windows and attribute a likely cause
  - `ThresholdBreachAgent` — checks raw readings against **placeholder operational sanity bounds**, not real EPA data (AWH telemetry doesn't map to standard EPA drinking-water limits — explicit decision 2026-07-31; swap in real values if this needs to answer to an actual regulatory framework)
  - `IncidentReportAgent` — RAG-grounded Claude (`claude-opus-5`) call; retrieval is keyword overlap over `guides/*.md` (not a vector DB — the corpus is ~3K lines, keyword ranking is sufficient)
  - `StakeholderEscalationAgent` — decides severity + routing and **logs the decision only** — no real notification channel wired up (explicit decision 2026-07-31)
- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `ant auth login`) to actually run the `IncidentReportAgent` LLM call — every other node runs with no external credentials.

### Phase 4 (Weeks 6–7) — Drift-Adaptive MLOps
- **Evidently AI** — data drift and model performance monitoring
- **Apache Airflow** — automated retraining DAG
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD with evaluation gates
- Target: recover to within 5% of pre-drift F1 within 48 hours of drift detection

### Phase 5 (Week 8) — Deployment and Evaluation
- **FastAPI** — extended serving for model predictions and agent outputs
- **Docker + Kubernetes** — full container orchestration
- **Grafana + Prometheus** — observability and alerting
- Structured 20-case expert evaluation study for RQ3

| LSTM + Isolation Forest + classifier + two-stage models | ✅ Built — LSTM best, attribution F1=0.415, well below RQ1's 0.80 target (see PENDING_TASKS.md Part C for the full 14-round history) |
| LangGraph multi-agent system (`research_extension/phase3_agents/`) | ✅ Built — SensorDriftAgent, ThresholdBreachAgent (placeholder thresholds, not real EPA data), IncidentReportAgent (RAG-grounded Claude call), StakeholderEscalationAgent (simulated routing, no real notifications sent). Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to actually run the LLM step. |
| Evidently + Airflow MLOps pipeline | 🔲 Week 6–7 |
| Kubernetes + Grafana deployment | 🔲 Week 8 |

## 12. How To Run Locally

### Backend API
```bash
cd awh_az/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your values
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Ingestion Worker
```bash
pip install -r requirements_ingestion.txt
python ingestion_worker.py
```

### Dashboard
```bash
cd az_awh_dashboard
npm install
npm run dev            # runs on localhost:3000
```

### Raspberry Pi Station
```bash
cd RPi_USB_Package
python AquaPars1.py    # full station runtime
# or test individual sensors (flat layout, no test_system/ subfolder):
python test_balance.py
python test_intake_anememoter.py
python test_outtaketake_anememoter.py
python test_flow.py
```

## 13. Key Design Decisions and Why

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Firebase as edge store → PostgreSQL as analytics store | Firebase gives the Pi a reliable cloud write target with no schema enforcement; PostgreSQL gives the backend efficient range queries and relational integrity. As of 2026-08-28, `/readings` and `/hourly` query Postgres directly (see KNOWN_ISSUES.md #1); `/stations`, `/stations-registry`, `/impact`, and `/export` still read Firestore directly — a deliberate hybrid, not an oversight, since those don't need Postgres's range-scan performance |
| `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in ingestion | Double idempotency: checkpoint prevents re-fetching; conflict clause prevents duplicates if checkpoint is stale after a crash |
| Atomic checkpoint write (`.tmp` → rename) | If process is killed mid-write, original checkpoint is intact — prevents re-ingesting all historical data on restart |
| All 14 sensor fields Optional in Pydantic | Different stations have different hardware configurations — schema tolerates heterogeneous setups without failing |
| TimescaleDB schema alongside simple PostgreSQL | Hypertables give 10–100× faster range queries at scale; simple schema for dev/low-volume deployments |
| Cache in front of API (Redis, falls back to in-process) | Dashboards repeatedly request the same date ranges — caching reduces DB load and latency for common read patterns. Redis was never provisioned in prod, so `cache.py`'s in-process fallback is what's actually running |
| udev rules for stable USB port names | Linux assigns ttyUSB numbers by plug-in order at boot — udev rules bind each sensor to a permanent symlink regardless of plug order |
| Time-based train/val/test split (not random) | Random splits on time-series data leak future information into training, producing falsely optimistic model evaluation |
