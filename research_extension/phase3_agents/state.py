"""
AWH Phase 3 — shared LangGraph state.

One IncidentState flows through all four agents for a single labeled window
(the same row shape train_phase2_models.py evaluates against — station_id,
window_start/end, the 4 target features' rel_* stat columns, raw readings).
Each agent only ever ADDS keys; nothing upstream is mutated, so the full
trace of who-said-what survives to the end for the incident report and the
final printed summary.
